      <em>Go Parks</em> is developed and operated by <strong>Tim Sopin</strong>.
      This page explains how the app handles your information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Anonymous analytics:</strong> The app uses Firebase Analytics to
        understand general usage (for example, which screens are most viewed).
        No personal or identifying data is collected or shared.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device data:</strong> Firebase may collect basic device
        information such as model, OS version, and app version for diagnostic
        and performance purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Don’t Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Go Parks does not collect or store names, emails, precise locations, or
      any personal identifiers. All favorites, visits, and preferences are
      stored locally on your device and never transmitted to servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      No personal data is sold or shared with third parties. Anonymous analytics
      data is processed by Google Firebase solely to help improve app quality.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      You can disable analytics at any time from your device’s privacy settings
      or by uninstalling the app. When Sign in with Apple becomes available,
      participation will be completely optional.
